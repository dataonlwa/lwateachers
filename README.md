# LWA Teachers, Students aand Information Assymetry
Information asymmetry comes about when one party has more information than another during a transaction. Such an asymmetry makes decision making harder for parties involved, particular if one has strictly more information than another. The education and economic future of a child should not be hurt by such an asymmetry.  Done with Veritas, Integritas, and Servitium in mind.
